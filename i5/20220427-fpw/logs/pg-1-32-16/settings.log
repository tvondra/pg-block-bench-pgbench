Setting ignore_invalid_pages to true causes the system to ignore invalid page references in WAL records (but still report a warning), and continue recovery. This behavior may cause crashes, data loss, propagate or hide corruption, or other serious problems. Only has an effect during recovery or in standby mode. | postmaster        | bool    | default              |             |              |                                                                                | off                            | off                                  |                                      |            | f
